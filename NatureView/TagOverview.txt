Tag Overview Documentation

  The convention for tags is as follows:

TAG: ATTRIBUTEA ATTRIBUTEB ATTRIBUTEC

  means that TAG is a top-level (scene top-level, anyway) tag, and it potentially
has attributes ATTRIBUTEA, ATTRIBUTEB and ATTRIBUTEC. It might be written as:

<TAG ATTRIBUTEA=VALUEA ATTRIBUTEB=VALUEB ATTRIBUTEC=VALUEC></TAG>

  You _don't_ need anything between the open tag and the close tag:
<TAG>Nothing important goes here.</TAG>

  The close tag doesn't accept any attributes:
<TAG></TAG VALUE="Nothing here either.">

  XML requires that there be a closing tag for every opening tag. NV is currently
not that strict, but I recommend following the XML convention as our parser may be
more restrictive in the future.

  XML requires that tags are case sensitive. I've adopted the convention (suggested by
Zack) that all TAGS are uppercase, but the attribute keywords are lowercase:

<TAG attributea=VALUEA attributeb=VALUEB attributec=VALUEC></TAG>

  XML requires that all attribute values be quoted:
<TAG attributea="VALUEA" attributeb="VALUEB" attributec="VALUEC"></TAG>

  NatureView currently allows unquoted attribute values if they have no whitespace
in them:

<TAG attributea=ThisIsOk></TAG>
but requires quotes for any values that have whitespace:

<TAG attributea=This Is Not Ok></TAG>
<TAG attributea="But This Is Ok"></TAG>

  We recommend following the XML convention, and Scene Express will write files this way.

  Where an indented tag follows the first line defining a TAG, this is a subtag:

TAG: ATTRIBUTE
	SUBTAG SUBATTRIBUTE

  An example would look like:
<TAG ATTRIBUTE="Value">
  <SUBTAG SUBATTRIBUTE="SubValue"></SUBTAG>
</TAG>

  Indenting the subtag is not required, but is recommended. Subtags may or may not have
subattributes. Some Tags may support multiple types of subtags and/or multiple instances
of a single subtag. Some may not.


End of Lines and Whitespace:

  The NatureView scene file format (NVW) is agnostic to CR/LF end of lines,
and in fact, is designed so that changing the EOLs or adding/removing blank lines should
not disrupt the NVW file signature. This should allow Mac/PC portability more easily.

  Technically, XML states tags can begin and end anywhere they want, and you
can have line breaks anywhere you want. NatureView isn't that permissive.
Tags should begin at the start of a line (generally, any amount of leading
spaces or tabs are permitted). Tags should complete on the same line. The
closing tag </TAGNAME> can either be on the same line, or a subsequent line.


Comments:

  XML-style Comments <!-- Blah --> are permitted. They can span multiple lines.
They can generally only be introduced on the beginning or end of a line.

<!-- This is ok -->

<!--
This is
also ok
-->

<BLAHTAG> <!-- this is not --> </BLAHTAG> 


Signature:

  The file signature (technically coded as an XML comment) should be the last
line of the file. NatureView will stop reading scene data upon finding the Signature.
The signature looks like:

<!-- SIGNATURE TYPE="NATUREVIEW" VALUE="ATMAidrjrQD6VrvEJyLzZHxof80U7m0M7Msr7W3N96Xmw4h78iBn1HCP0jvj+0VUUlZH" -->

  TYPE must be present, and must currently be NATUREVIEW. No other values are currently
defined.

  VALUE is the ASCII-coded encrpyted signature of the file. It can only be caclulated by
Scene Express. Scene express can append a signature to an NVW file that has none, or will
strip and rewrite an existing signature. It does not rewrite any other signatures in the
NVW file.


Framing Syntax:

  Typically a NatureView file begins with:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<NATUREVIEW>

  and end with

</NATUREVIEW>

  The first line identifies it as an XML file. The NATUREVIEW tags pair is known as the
Document element in XML.

  The VERSION tag is usually found inside/between the NATUREVIEW scene tag but not within
the SCENE tag pair (below). Other future tags may be found outside the SCENE element pair.


VERSION: FILEVERSION PREFERREDVIEWER

  If FILEVERSION is greater than the version number compiled into NatureView, NV will display an
error and not display the scene.

  If PREFERREDVIEWER is not the same as the string compiled into the NatureView viewer, NV will
present a warning, but will still allow the scene to display.


SCENE: NAME THUMB

  Both the NAME and THUMB tags are ignored at this time. It is anticipated that these will be used
to identify (textually and graphically) multiple SCENEs stored in one file, for viewers that support
multiple encapsulated Scenarios.

  Within the SCENE element are found the majority of the interesting tags.



SPLASH: TIME

  The time attribute defines how long the splash/version display will show, in decimal seconds.
Time = 0.0 will suppress the display of the splash entirely.


DEM: FILENAME DRAPEIMAGEFILENAME DEMSIG DRAPESIG

  This tag adds a DEM to the scene. Currently only one DEM tag is supported. DRAPEIMAGEFILENAME
specifies the image to be draped over the image. The image's georeferencing will be ignored and
the image will be stretched to fit the DEM. The image may need to be power-of-two in dimension.
The DEM does not have any size requirements, but it may perform better if it has dimensions of
power-of-two-plus-one. A signature (SIG) for the DEM file itself and the Drape Image (DRAPESIG)
is required in order to display the terrain.


INSTANCEFILE: FILENAME FOLIAGETYPE SIG

  This tag adds a file of foliage instances. Currently only one foliage instance file is supported.
A signature (SIG) is required. FOLIAGETYPE can be BILLBOARDS, CROSSBOARDS or SPRITES. Billboards
is the recommended and default value.


NAVIGATION: SPEED FOLLOWTERRAINHEIGHT STYLE

  This tag controls navigation parameters. SPEED is the maximum rate of travel, and also controls
the rate of acceleration. STYLE currently is ignored, but may select other navigation styles in
the future. FOLLOWTERRAINHEIGHT is intended to enforce terrain-following, but does not function
properly at this time.


OVERLAY: LOGOFILENAME TEXT LOGOSIG NUMLINES

  This tag controls the bottom Overlay line. This overlay can have a graphic logo, some text, or
both. If either text or a logo filename is specified, the overlay will be enabled. The overlay
can be toggled by keyboard control. At this time the text cannot have multiple lines or special
control characters. It is anticipated that the text will accept formatting characters similarly
to the PostProcess text component, allowing for insertion of dynamically updated text strings
such as camera position, etc. NUMLINES allows for specification of the height (in lines of text)
of the Overlay bar. It defaults to four lines. In the future, it will autosize to the number of
lines of actual text. The logo (if present) automatically scales to the height of the Overlay bar.
The size of the image is unimportant, it will be proportionally scaled (and antialiased) down to
fit. An alpha channel, if present, will be used to render portions of the logo translucent or
transparent. The only format this has been tested and known working with at this time is PNG. The
logo image file requires a LOGOSIG argument. Anticipated future features include specification
of the color and opacity of the overlay bar. 


WATERMARK: TEXT

  This tag creates an indelible text watermark, centered in the mid-to-high region of the screen.
The watermark can NOT be disabled at runtime -- it can only be removed by editing and re-signing
the NVW file. The re-signing can only be done by Scene Express. This means that a watermark such
as "PRERELEASE -- NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE" can be embedded on the scene when delivered to a client,
preventing the client from effectively using the scene until permitted by the creator.


META: NAME COPYRIGHT AUTHOR USER1 USER2 USER3 USER4 USER5

  The attributes of this tag are used for conveying metadata to the viewer. The viewer may use this
in a variety of ways. In the future, the metadata might be accessible as special formatting symbols
in the Overlay.


LOD: CLIPNEAR CLIPFAR MINFEATURESIZEPIXELS TERRAINCLIP FOLIAGECLIP OBJECTCLIP OBJECTBOX

  This tag specified some Level Of Detail parameters. CLIPNEAR and CLIPFAR manually specify near and
far clipping planes if you want to artificially chop off far or near items. By default, the near and
far are automatically computed to encompass all scene geometry. MINFEATURESIZEPIXELS controls the
automatic culling of features that fall below a minimum onscreen pixel size threshold. It defaults
to 0, effectively disabled. TERRAINCLIP, FOLIAGECLIP, OBJECTCLIP and OBJECTBOX are not yet implemented.


  The following tags all support (and essentially require) a KEY subtag. It is intended that this will
support animated values, though at this time, only the first KEY subtag is used. The TIME attribute is
currently ignored.


OBJINSTANCE: FILENAME SIG
	KEY: TIME LONGITUDE/X LATITUDE/Y ELEVATION/Z HEADING PITCH BANK SCALEX SCALEY SCALEZ 

  FILENAME and SIG specify the file and signature for the 3D object.

  The subtag attributes should be essentially obvious. It is believed that the Z argument is not
currently working, though the ELEVATION synonym appears to be. H, P and B may not yet be applied in
the correct order.


SKY: TYPE
	KEY TIME FILENAME INTENSITY

  FILENAME specifies the file for the spherical panoramic image to be used for the Sky. Intensity is not
currently used.


OCEAN
	KEY TIME FILENAME SIG ELEVATION SPECULARITY REFLECTIVITY REFLECTIONMAPFILE REFMAPSIG

  Ocean is not completely supported right now, but is somewhat useful nonetheless. It creates a flat
plane at a given ELEVATION, textured with a given texture image FILENAME (SIG is required). Specularity
and reflectivity (as well as REFLECTIONMAPFILE REFMAPSIG) are essentially not functional.


CAMERA: NAME
	KEY TIME LONGITUDE/X LATITUDE/Y ELEVATION/Z HEADING PITCH BANK TARGETLATITUDE TARGETLONGITUDE TARGETELEVATION HFOV

  This is an important one. Without a CAMERA, NatureView will choose a camera position automatically.
HEADING and PITCH are not supported right now -- Scene Express synthesizes an artifical target
position that encompasses all camera aiming info. BANK and HFOV are not (yet) supported.


HAZE: TYPE
	KEY TIME START RANGE STARTINTENSITY ENDINTENSITY

  TYPE currently only supports LINEAR. START and RANGE are in meters, and act just like they do in
WCS and VNS. STARTINTENSITY and ENDINTENSITY are likewise, percentages in the range of 0 to 1.0.
Only one intensity (START) is actully supported by basic OpenGL. COLOR is specified in HTML-style,
as in:
color="#81739E"



Startup Arguments:

SCENE=MyFile.nvw
(or just specify MyFile.nvw without SCENE=)
