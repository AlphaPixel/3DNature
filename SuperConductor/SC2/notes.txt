Known issues:

-Client sharing between clients is broken.  Don't use a client on more than one project at the same time.  Can use them in projects started concurrently.

-Unpausing doesn't work yet.  Stop/run will work.

-Some path remembering is funky.  Doesn't always work, doesn't work between runs of Superconductor.

-Time until finished estimation not working, nor is time per frame

-Projects with no working clients show Error status.  Not entirely robust code, can cause problems if: You get an error, fix the issue with VNS, and then try starting the project from Superconductor again.
